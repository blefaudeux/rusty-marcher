# rusty-marcher

[Work in progress] 
Ray marcher inspired by https://github.com/ssloy/tinyraytracer/wiki, with a couple of changes or additions: written in Rust (first project for me, so probably very naive), and taking some multispectral components into account (well, R/G/B indices for everything from reflexion/refraction/diffusion/lighting).

Current state of affairs: (https://github.com/blefaudeux/rusty-marcher/blob/master/engine/out.ppm)

how to run: `cargo run`
